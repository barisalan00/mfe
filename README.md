# Migration Flows to Europe

This project builds a regression model to measure the impact and the significance of various factors on migration flows from non-EU countries to the EU countries: economic (GPD per capita and multidimensional poverty), political (political stability and effectiveness of government), gender (gender inequality), conflict (armed conflict and social unrest), and climate (climate related risks).
